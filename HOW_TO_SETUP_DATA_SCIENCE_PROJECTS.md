# Install Anaconda3
1. Go to Anaconda's website and install Anaconda for your operating system.
2. After Anaconda is installed, then make sure that Python3 and Pip3 are on your PATH variable. In a terminal run `which python3` and then `which pip3`. Those commands should return a file path to your Anaconda installation.
3. `conda` is Anaconda's package manager. Make sure that your conda installation worked: `conda --version`. If that returns a version number, then you have installed Anaconda3 and conda correctly.

# Run JupyterLab inside a virtual environment (RECOMMENDED)
Every data science project you do will require some combination of external libraries, sometimes with specific versions that differ from the specific versions you used for other projects. If you were to have a single Python installation, these libraries would conflict and cause you all sorts of problems. 

The standard solution is to use virtual environments, which are sandboxed Python environments that maintain their own versions of Python libraries (and, depending on how you set up the environment, of Python itself).

As a matter of good discipline, you should always work in a virtual environment, and never using the "base" Python installation.

## Step 1: Create an `environment.yml` file in your project root directory
You can create and activate virtual environments with conda. (See [Managing environments](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html).)

First, create an `environment.yml` file in your project root directory. Here is an example of an `environment.yml` file:

```yml
name: name-of-virtual-environment
channels:
  - conda
  - conda-forge
dependencies:
  - python=3.9.5
  - pip
  - python-graphviz
  - pip:
    - scikit-learn==0.24.0
    - pandas==1.2.0
    - seaborn==0.11.1
    - imbalanced-learn==0.7.0
    - numpy==1.19.5
    - matplotlib==3.3.3
    - kmodes==0.11.0
    - six==1.15.0
    - pydotplus==2.0.2
    - statsmodels==0.12.1
    - ipykernel==6.15.2
    - jupyterlab==3.4.5
```

Notice the `ipykernel` and `jupyterlab` packages at the end of the above list. I will give more details about those later.

For reference, here is an `environment.yml` file that could be used with a Python backend for web development, if you are not using Docker as your development environment:

```yml
name: name-of-virtual-environment
dependencies:
  - python=3.6
  - pip=21.0
  # You need to list pip as a dependency and then list any packages that need to be installed by pip after all the dependencies that are to be installed by conda.

  - pip:
    - fastapi
    - uvicorn
    - aiofiles
    - plotly==4.14.3
    - pandas==1.1.5
```

<br>

<br>

## Step 2: Create your virtual environment
In a terminal window `cd` into your project directory and run

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

This will install the virtual environment that is specified in your `environment.yml` file. In case you see a prompt asking you to confirm before proceeding, type `y` and press Enter to continue creating the environment. Depending on your system configuration, it may take a while for the process to complete.

<br>

## Step 3: Verify that the new virtual environment was installed correctly
In your terminal type:

```
conda env list
```

You should see the name of your virtual environment in that list, which is the `name` specified in your `environment.yml` file.

<br>

## Step 4: Activate your virtual environment
```
conda activate <name-of-virtual-environment>
```

Once your virtual environment has been activated, your command prompt should be prefixed with the name of your virtual environment. For example:

```
(name-of-virtual-environment) ~/code/data-science/...
```

<br>

## Step 5: Run JupyterLab inside your virtual environment
Run the following command inside your activated virtual environment:

```
jupyter-lab
```

When you run `jupyter-lab` the JupyterLab server will run and an instance of JupyterLab will open up in a browser window. The following are a couple of indicators that you are running JupyterLab from inside a virtual environment:

1. The output in the terminal where you ran `jupyter-lab` should have the following two lines *(which indicate that JupyterLab is being served from the `/path/to/anaconda3/envs/` directory, which is where the virtual environments are stored)*:

```
[I 2022-09-07 09:31:23.835 LabApp] JupyterLab extension loaded from /path/to/anaconda3/envs/ds-marketing/lib/python3.9/site-packages/jupyterlab
[I 2022-09-07 09:31:23.835 LabApp] JupyterLab application directory is /path/to/anaconda3/envs/ds-marketing/share/jupyter/lab
```

2. When JupyterLab first loads up in your browser, under the "Launcher" tab you will see options for "Python 3 (ipykernel)" under the "Notebook" and "Console" headings. 

<br>

**So what is `ipykernel`?**

*The Jupyter Notebook and other frontends automatically ensure that the IPython kernel is available. However, if you want to use a kernel with a different version of Python, or in a virtualenv or conda environment, youâ€™ll need to install that manually.* (Source [Installing the IPython kernal](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install/kernel_install.html#:~:text=The%20IPython%20kernel%20is%20the,need%20to%20install%20that%20manually.))

Since we are using JupyterLab, instead of Jupyter Notebooks, we are able to run it inside of a virtual environment in a pretty automated and easy way. I don't think that is possible with Jupyter Notebooks, but I could be wrong.

<br>

NOTE:
If you need to use Jupyter Notebooks, then I think you will have to install `ipykernel` and run Jupyter Notebooks inside a virtual environment a different (and more manual) way. For details, refer to the Preface of the book I own titled "Data Science for Marketing Analytics".

## How to deactivate a virtual environment
When you are done working on a particular project you can deactivate the virtual environment with:

```
conda deactivate
```

See [Deactivating an environment](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#deactivating-an-environment)

<br>

## How to delete a virtual environment
First make sure your environment is deactivated. Then run this command:

```
conda env remove --name name-of-environment
```

You can verify that your virtual environment has been deleted by running

```
conda env list
```

<br><br>

# Install JupyterLab and run it outside of a virtual environment (NOT RECOMMENDED)

Install JupyterLab with `pip`:

```
pip install jupyterlab
```

Note: If you install JupyterLab with conda or mamba, we recommend using the conda-forge channel.

<br>

Check that JupyterLab installed correctly:

```
jupyter-lab --version
```

<br>

Once installed, launch JupyterLab with:

```
jupyter-lab
```
